# Readable

 This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## Run

Clone the repo to your local machine. Install dependencies with command `yarn` (or `npm i`) then start app with `yarn start` (or `npm start`). You will need the dummy backend server from [here](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-readable-starter) running on port 5001.

## Test

Run `yarn test a` or `npm test a` to execute tests. I wrote only the most basic unit tests for components.
